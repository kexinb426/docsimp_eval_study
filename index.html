            <h2>Original Document</h2>
            <p>Banksia aculeata, commonly known as prickly banksia, is a species of plant of the family Proteaceae native to the Stirling Range in the southwest of Western Australia. A shrub up to 2 m (7 ft) tall, it has dense foliage and leaves with very prickly serrated margins. Its unusual pinkish, pendent (hanging) flower spikes, known as inflorescences, are generally hidden in the foliage and appear during the early summer. Although it was collected by the naturalist James Drummond in the 1840s, Banksia aculeata was not formally described until 1981, by Alex George in his monograph of the genus.
A rare plant, Banksia aculeata is found in gravelly soils in elevated areas. Native to a habitat burnt by periodic bushfires, it is killed by fire and regenerates from seed afterwards. In contrast to other Western Australian banksias, it appears to have some resistance to the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi.</p>

            <h2>Simplified Document</h2>
            <p>Banksia aculeata, also called prickly banksia, is a type of plant from the Proteaceae family. It naturally grows in the Stirling Range in the southwest of Western Australia. This shrub can grow up to about 2 meters (7 feet) tall. It has thick leaves with very sharp, jagged edges. It has unusual pinkish flowers that hang downwards and are generally hidden in the leaves, showing up in early summer. Even though the naturalist James Drummond collected it in the 1840s, Banksia aculeata was not officially described until 1981 by Alex George in his detailed study of the species.
Banksia aculeata is a rare plant that grows in gravelly soils in high places. It lives in areas that get burned by bushfires from time to time. The plant is killed by fire, but regrows from its seeds afterwards. Unlike other banksias in Western Australia, it seems to be somewhat resistant to a soil-borne mould called Phytophthora cinnamomi.</p>
