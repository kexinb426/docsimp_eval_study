        "original": "The Huguenot-Walloon half dollar or Huguenot-Walloon Tercentenary half dollar is a commemorative coin issued by the United States Bureau of the Mint in 1924. It marks the 300th anniversary of the voyage of the Nieuw Nederlandt which landed in the New York area in 1624. Many of the passengers were Huguenots from France or French-speaking  Walloons from what is now Belgium; they became early settlers of New York State and the surrounding area.\nA commission run by the Federal Council of Churches in America sought issuance of a half dollar to mark the anniversary, and the bill passed through Congress without opposition in 1923 and was signed by President Warren G. Harding. Sketches were prepared by commission chairman Reverend John Baer Stoudt and converted to plaster models by the Mint's aging chief engraver, George T. Morgan. The models were initially rejected by the Commission of Fine Arts, which required revisions under the supervision of Buffalo nickel designer James Earle Fraser.\nOf the 300,000 coins authorized by Congress, fewer than half were actually struck, and of these, 55,000 were returned to the Mint and released into circulation. The coin excited some controversy because of its sponsorship by a religious group. The choice of William the Silent and Gaspard de Coligny to appear on the obverse was also questioned as the men are considered martyrs by the Huguenots and died decades before the voyage of the Nieuw Nederlandt. The coins are currently valued in the hundreds of dollars, depending on condition.\n\n",
        "simplified": "The United States made a special coin in 1924 called the Huguenot-Walloon half dollar. This coin celebrated the 300th anniversary of a ship called the Nieuw Nederlandt arriving in New York in 1624. Many people on this ship were Huguenots from France and Walloons from what is now Belgium. These people helped start new communities in New York and nearby areas.\n\nA group of churches asked the government to make this coin. President Warren G. Harding agreed, and Congress approved it in 1923. A church leader named John Baer Stoudt drew the first designs. George T. Morgan, an older coin designer, turned these drawings into 3D models. At first, an art committee didn't like the designs. They asked for changes, which were overseen by James Earle Fraser, who had designed another famous coin.\n\nThe government allowed 300,000 coins to be made, but less than half were actually produced. Of these, 55,000 were later put into regular use as money. Some people didn't like that a religious group was involved in making the coin. Others questioned why William the Silent and Gaspard de Coligny were on the coin, as these men died long before the ship's voyage.\n\nToday, these coins are worth hundreds of dollars, depending on how well they've been kept.",

It was created to celebrate 300 years since the Nieuw Nederlandt ship arrived in the New York area in 1624. Many people on the ship were Huguenots from France or French-speaking Walloons from what is now Belgium. They helped settle New York State.\n\nA group called the Federal Council of Churches in America wanted a half dollar coin made for the anniversary. The idea was approved by Congress without any disagreement in 1923 and signed into law by President Warren G. Harding. Reverend John Baer Stoudt created sketches for the coin, which were turned into models by George T. Morgan, the Mint's chief engraver. The Commission of Fine Arts did not approve the first models, so changes were made with help from James Earle Fraser, who designed the Buffalo nickel.\n\nAlthough Congress allowed 300,000 coins to be made, less than half were produced. Of these, 55,000 were sent back to the Mint and put into circulation as money. The coin caused some disagreement because a religious group requested it. People also questioned why William the Silent and Gaspard de Coligny were pictured on the front. These men are seen as heroes by the Huguenots, but they died many years before the Nieuw Nederlandt's voyage. Today, the coins are worth several hundred dollars, depending on their condition.",

        "original": "The Huguenot-Walloon half dollar or Huguenot-Walloon Tercentenary half dollar is a commemorative coin issued by the United States Bureau of the Mint in 1924. It marks the 300th anniversary of the voyage of the Nieuw Nederlandt which landed in the New York area in 1624. Many of the passengers were Huguenots from France or French-speaking  Walloons from what is now Belgium; they became early settlers of New York State and the surrounding area.\nA commission run by the Federal Council of Churches in America sought issuance of a half dollar to mark the anniversary, and the bill passed through Congress without opposition in 1923 and was signed by President Warren G. Harding. Sketches were prepared by commission chairman Reverend John Baer Stoudt and converted to plaster models by the Mint's aging chief engraver, George T. Morgan. The models were initially rejected by the Commission of Fine Arts, which required revisions under the supervision of Buffalo nickel designer James Earle Fraser.\nOf the 300,000 coins authorized by Congress, fewer than half were actually struck, and of these, 55,000 were returned to the Mint and released into circulation. The coin excited some controversy because of its sponsorship by a religious group. The choice of William the Silent and Gaspard de Coligny to appear on the obverse was also questioned as the men are considered martyrs by the Huguenots and died decades before the voyage of the Nieuw Nederlandt. The coins are currently valued in the hundreds of dollars, depending on condition.\n\n",
        "simplified": "In 1924, the United States Mint made a special coin called the Huguenot-Walloon half dollar to celebrate a historic event. This coin marked the 300th anniversary of a ship called the Nieuw Nederlandt, which arrived in the New York area in 1624. Many people on board were Huguenots – French Protestants – and French-speaking Walloons – people from what is now Belgium. They were among the first settlers in New York and the surrounding region.\n\nA group of churches asked the government to create a coin to honor this anniversary, and Congress approved the idea in 1923. President Warren G. Harding signed the law. A man named Reverend John Baer Stoudt, who led the church group, helped design the coin, and the Mint’s chief engraver, George T. Morgan, made plaster models based on his designs.\n\nHowever, the Commission of Fine Arts, which checked the designs, didn’t like them at first and asked for changes. James Earle Fraser, who designed the Buffalo nickel, helped improve the designs.  Congress had authorized 300,000 coins, but only about 55,000 were actually made and put into circulation.\n\nThe coin caused some debate because it was supported by a religious group. Also, some people questioned why William the Silent and Gaspard de Coligny were chosen to be on the coin’s front – they are considered martyrs by the Huguenots and died long before the ship arrived. Today, these coins are worth hundreds of dollars, depending on how well they are preserved.",
