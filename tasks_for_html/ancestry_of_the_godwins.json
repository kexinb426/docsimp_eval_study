When King Edward the Confessor died in January 1066 his closest relative was his great-nephew, Edgar the Ætheling, but he was young and lacked powerful supporters. Harold was the head of the most powerful family in England and Edward's brother-in-law, and he became king. In September 1066 Harold defeated and killed King Harald Hardrada of Norway at the Battle of Stamford Bridge, and Harold was himself defeated and killed the following month by William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings.\nThe family is named after Harold's father, Earl Godwin, who had risen to a position of wealth and influence in the 1020s under Danish King Cnut the Great. In 1045 Godwin's daughter, Edith, married King Edward the Confessor, and by the mid-1050s Harold and his brothers had become dominant, almost monopolising the English earldoms. Godwin's origin is obscure. He was probably the son of Wulfnoth Cild, a South Saxon thegn, but Wulfnoth's ancestry is disputed. A few genealogists and historians argue that he was descended from Alfred the Great's elder brother, King Æthelred I (865–71), but almost all historians of Anglo-Saxon England reject this theory.",
        "simplified": "Here's a simplified version of the text:\n\nWe don't know much about the family history of Harold II, the last Anglo-Saxon king of England. When King Edward the Confessor died in January 1066, his closest relative was his young great-nephew, Edgar. However, Edgar didn't have strong supporters. Harold, who was the most powerful man in England and Edward's brother-in-law, became king instead.\n\nIn September 1066, Harold defeated and killed the Norwegian King Harald Hardrada in battle. But the next month, Harold himself was killed by William the Conqueror in the Battle of Hastings.\n\nHarold's family is named after his father, Earl Godwin. Godwin became rich and powerful in the 1020s under the Danish King Cnut. In 1045, Godwin's daughter Edith married King Edward. By the mid-1050s, Harold and his brothers controlled most of the important positions in England.\n\nWe're not sure about Godwin's background. He was probably the son of Wulfnoth Cild, a local leader from southern England, but we don't know much about Wulfnoth's family. Some people think Godwin was related to King Alfred the Great's older brother, but most experts don't believe this.",

When King Edward the Confessor died in January 1066 his closest relative was his great-nephew, Edgar the Ætheling, but he was young and lacked powerful supporters. Harold was the head of the most powerful family in England and Edward's brother-in-law, and he became king. In September 1066 Harold defeated and killed King Harald Hardrada of Norway at the Battle of Stamford Bridge, and Harold was himself defeated and killed the following month by William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings.\nThe family is named after Harold's father, Earl Godwin, who had risen to a position of wealth and influence in the 1020s under Danish King Cnut the Great. In 1045 Godwin's daughter, Edith, married King Edward the Confessor, and by the mid-1050s Harold and his brothers had become dominant, almost monopolising the English earldoms. Godwin's origin is obscure. He was probably the son of Wulfnoth Cild, a South Saxon thegn, but Wulfnoth's ancestry is disputed. A few genealogists and historians argue that he was descended from Alfred the Great's elder brother, King Æthelred I (865–71), but almost all historians of Anglo-Saxon England reject this theory.",

Harold Godwin was a very important family leader in England, and he was also Edward’s brother-in-law, so he became king. In September 1066, Harold won a victory against King Harald Hardrada of Norway at the Battle of Stamford Bridge, but he was later defeated and killed by William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings the following month.\n\nThe Godwin family’s name comes from Harold’s father, Earl Godwin. Earl Godwin became rich and powerful in the 1020s while serving King Cnut the Great, who was Danish. In 1045, Godwin’s daughter, Edith, married King Edward the Confessor. By the mid-1050s, Harold and his brothers had become the most powerful landowners in England, almost controlling all the earldoms (important regions ruled by earls).\n\nHowever, where Godwin himself came from is unclear. He was likely the son of Wulfnoth Cild, a nobleman from the south of England. But there’s a lot of debate about Wulfnoth’s family history. Some people believe he might be descended from Alfred the Great’s older brother, King Æthelred I, but most historians who study Anglo-Saxon England disagree with this idea.",
