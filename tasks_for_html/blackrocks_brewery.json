        "original": "Blackrocks Brewery is a craft brewery in Marquette, Michigan, United States. Former pharmaceutical salesmen David Manson and Andy Langlois opened Blackrocks in 2010, taking the name from a local landmark. They originally brewed their products in the basement of a Victorian-style house and used the building's other two floors as a taproom.\nBy 2013, persistent demand for Blackrocks' beer led Manson and Langlois to add an outdoor patio and increase their brewing capacity. This included purchasing and converting a nearby former Coca-Cola bottling plant. In the early 2020s, they expanded the brewery's taproom into an adjacent property to double its available indoor area. As of 2024, Blackrocks is the largest craft brewery in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Their most popular beer is 51K, an American IPA.\n\n",
        "simplified": "Blackrocks Brewery is a small beer-making company in Marquette, Michigan. Two men, David Manson and Andy Langlois, started it in 2010. They used to sell medicine before opening the brewery. They named it after a well-known place in the area.\n\nAt first, they made beer in the basement of an old-style house. They used the other parts of the house to serve customers.\n\nIn 2013, many people wanted their beer. So, Manson and Langlois added an outdoor seating area and made more beer. They bought an old Coca-Cola factory nearby to make even more beer.\n\nIn the early 2020s, they made their serving area bigger by using the building next door. This gave them twice as much indoor space.\n\nAs of 2024, Blackrocks is the biggest small beer-making company in the northern part of Michigan. Their most popular beer is called 51K, which is a type of beer known as an American IPA.",

Former pharmaceutical salesmen David Manson and Andy Langlois opened Blackrocks in 2010, taking the name from a local landmark. They originally brewed their products in the basement of a Victorian-style house and used the building's other two floors as a taproom.\nBy 2013, persistent demand for Blackrocks' beer led Manson and Langlois to add an outdoor patio and increase their brewing capacity. This included purchasing and converting a nearby former Coca-Cola bottling plant. In the early 2020s, they expanded the brewery's taproom into an adjacent property to double its available indoor area. As of 2024, Blackrocks is the largest craft brewery in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Their most popular beer is 51K, an American IPA.\n\n",
        "simplified": "Blackrocks Brewery is a small, independent brewery located in Marquette, Michigan. It was started in 2010 by two former drug sales people, David Manson and Andy Langlois, who chose the name because of a local rock formation. At first, they brewed their beer in the basement of a historic house and used the rest of the house as a place to sell it directly to customers.\n\nBecause people really liked their beer, they started expanding in 2013. They added an outdoor seating area and built a bigger brewing area by buying and renovating an old Coca-Cola bottling plant. In the early 2020s, they also added more space to their taproom by building onto a neighboring property, making it twice as big. \n\nAs of 2024, Blackrocks is now the biggest craft brewery in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. Their most popular beer is called 51K, and it’s a type of American IPA.",
