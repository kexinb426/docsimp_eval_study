        "original": "The Longing is a 2020 point-and-click adventure game created by independent developer Studio Seufz. Set in an underground kingdom, the player controls the Shade, a creature tasked with watching over a sleeping king for 400 days. The Shade performs recreational activities, including reading and exploring, as it waits out the 400 days in real time. The in-game timer continues regardless of the player's actions but moves faster if the Shade performs certain actions inside its home, such as decorating the walls with drawings.\nDeveloper Anselm Pyta conceived of The Longing after hearing the Kyffh√§user legend while visiting the Barbarossa Cave. Pyta sought to explore emotional themes in a narrative-driven story and used time as a game mechanism. The developer was inspired by dungeon synth music, which helped him define the subterranean atmosphere and theme of loneliness. Pyta acted as the primary developer for most of the game's six-year production, having to rely upon personal intuition to design the pacing due to playtesting difficulties.\nThe Longing was first released for Windows, macOS, and Linux on March 5, 2020. It gained praise for its soundtrack, visuals, and experimental nature, but the slow-paced gameplay divided critics. The game was released during the COVID-19 pandemic, and many commentators compared it to life under quarantine. The Longing was a finalist for the Nuovo Award at the 2020 Independent Games Festival and won the \"Best Debut\" award at the 2020 Deutscher Computerspielpreis.\n\n",
        "simplified": "The Longing is a 2020 computer game made by a small team called Studio Seufz. In the game, you control a character called the Shade who lives underground. The Shade's job is to watch over a sleeping king for 400 real-life days. While waiting, the Shade can do things like read books and explore. The game's timer keeps going even when you're not playing, but it goes faster if the Shade does certain things at home, like drawing on the walls.\n\nThe game's creator, Anselm Pyta, got the idea from an old German story he heard while visiting a cave. He wanted to make a game about feelings and use time as part of how the game works. He was inspired by a type of music called dungeon synth, which helped him create the underground feeling and sense of being alone in the game. Pyta worked mostly by himself for six years to make the game. It was hard to test the game because it takes so long to play.\n\nThe Longing came out on March 5, 2020, for Windows, Mac, and Linux computers. People liked the game's music, how it looked, and how different it was. However, some people didn't like how slow the game was. The game came out during the COVID-19 pandemic, and many people compared it to living in lockdown. The Longing was nominated for an award at a game festival and won a prize for being the best first game from a new developer in Germany.",

Set in an underground kingdom, the player controls the Shade, a creature tasked with watching over a sleeping king for 400 days. The Shade performs recreational activities, including reading and exploring, as it waits out the 400 days in real time. The in-game timer continues regardless of the player's actions but moves faster if the Shade performs certain actions inside its home, such as decorating the walls with drawings.\nDeveloper Anselm Pyta conceived of The Longing after hearing the Kyffh√§user legend while visiting the Barbarossa Cave. Pyta sought to explore emotional themes in a narrative-driven story and used time as a game mechanism. The developer was inspired by dungeon synth music, which helped him define the subterranean atmosphere and theme of loneliness. Pyta acted as the primary developer for most of the game's six-year production, having to rely upon personal intuition to design the pacing due to playtesting difficulties.\nThe Longing was first released for Windows, macOS, and Linux on March 5, 2020. It gained praise for its soundtrack, visuals, and experimental nature, but the slow-paced gameplay divided critics. The game was released during the COVID-19 pandemic, and many commentators compared it to life under quarantine. The Longing was a finalist for the Nuovo Award at the 2020 Independent Games Festival and won the \"Best Debut\" award at the 2020 Deutscher Computerspielpreis.\n\n",
        "simplified": "‚ÄúThe Longing‚Äù is a computer game that came out in 2020 and was made by a small team called Studio Seufz. It‚Äôs a puzzle game where you play as a shadowy creature named the Shade. The Shade has to watch over a sleeping king for 400 days, and you do this by exploring a hidden underground kingdom. You can do things like read books and look around, and the game‚Äôs clock keeps ticking, even if you‚Äôre not doing anything. However, if you do certain activities in your home, like drawing on the walls, the clock goes faster.\n\nThe game‚Äôs creator, Anselm Pyta, got the idea after hearing a story about a legendary figure in a cave. He wanted to make a game that felt emotional and told a story, and he used the idea of time as a key part of the game. He was also inspired by a type of music called ‚Äúdungeon synth,‚Äù which helped him create a feeling of being alone underground. Pyta worked on the game for six years mostly by himself, and it was tricky to figure out how fast the game should go because it was hard to get feedback from playtesters.\n\nThe game was first released on computers running Windows, Mac, and Linux on March 5, 2020. People who played it liked the music and the way it looked, and they thought it was a unique game. However, some critics said it was too slow. It came out during the time when many people were stuck at home because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and some people compared that experience to playing the game. ‚ÄúThe Longing‚Äù was even nominated for an award at a game festival and won an award for being a great new game in 2020.",
