        "original": "Edward Mitchell Bannister (November 2, 1828 – January 9, 1901) was a Canadian–American oil painter of the American Barbizon school. Born in colonial New Brunswick, he spent his adult life in New England in the United States. There, along with his wife Christiana Carteaux, he was a prominent member of African-American cultural and political communities, such as the Boston abolition movement. Bannister received national recognition after he won a first prize in painting at the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition. He was also a founding member of the Providence Art Club and the Rhode Island School of Design.\nBannister's style and predominantly pastoral subject matter reflected his admiration for the French artist Jean-François Millet and the French Barbizon school. A lifelong sailor, he also looked to the Rhode Island seaside for inspiration. Bannister continually experimented, and his artwork displays his Idealist philosophy and his control of color and atmosphere. He began his professional practice as a photographer and portraitist before developing his better-known landscape style.\nLater in his life, Bannister's style of landscape painting fell out of favor. With decreasing painting sales, he and Christiana Carteaux moved out of College Hill in Providence to Boston and then a smaller house on Wilson Street in Providence. Bannister was overlooked in American art historical studies and exhibitions after his death in 1901, until institutions like the National Museum of African Art returned him to national attention in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n",
        "simplified": "Edward Mitchell Bannister was a painter who lived from 1828 to 1901. He was born in Canada but spent most of his life in the United States. Bannister was known for his oil paintings of nature scenes, similar to a group of French artists called the Barbizon school.\n\nBannister and his wife, Christiana Carteaux, were important members of the African-American community. They were involved in movements to end slavery in Boston. In 1876, Bannister won a major prize at a big art show in Philadelphia. This made him famous across the country. He also helped start an art club in Providence and an art school in Rhode Island.\n\nBannister loved to paint outdoor scenes, especially those inspired by the seaside in Rhode Island. He was also a sailor. His paintings show his skill with colors and creating mood. He started his career as a photographer and portrait painter before focusing on landscapes.\n\nAs he got older, people became less interested in Bannister's style of painting. He and his wife had to move to smaller homes because they weren't selling as many paintings. After Bannister died in 1901, people forgot about him for many years. It wasn't until the 1960s and 1970s that museums started to show his work again and remind people of his importance.",

A sailor all his life, Bannister often found ideas for his paintings at the Rhode Island seaside. He liked to try new things, and his paintings show his Idealist ideas and skill with color and mood. He started out working as a photographer and portrait artist before becoming famous for his landscapes.\n\nTowards the end of his life, Bannister's landscape paintings were not as popular. This led to fewer sales, so he and Christiana Carteaux moved from College Hill in Providence to Boston and then to a smaller house on Wilson Street in Providence. After Bannister died in 1901, people didn't pay much attention to his work until the 1960s and 1970s when places like the National Museum of African Art helped bring him back into the spotlight.",

        "original": "Edward Mitchell Bannister (November 2, 1828 – January 9, 1901) was a Canadian–American oil painter of the American Barbizon school. Born in colonial New Brunswick, he spent his adult life in New England in the United States. There, along with his wife Christiana Carteaux, he was a prominent member of African-American cultural and political communities, such as the Boston abolition movement. Bannister received national recognition after he won a first prize in painting at the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition. He was also a founding member of the Providence Art Club and the Rhode Island School of Design.\nBannister's style and predominantly pastoral subject matter reflected his admiration for the French artist Jean-François Millet and the French Barbizon school. A lifelong sailor, he also looked to the Rhode Island seaside for inspiration. Bannister continually experimented, and his artwork displays his Idealist philosophy and his control of color and atmosphere. He began his professional practice as a photographer and portraitist before developing his better-known landscape style.\nLater in his life, Bannister's style of landscape painting fell out of favor. With decreasing painting sales, he and Christiana Carteaux moved out of College Hill in Providence to Boston and then a smaller house on Wilson Street in Providence. Bannister was overlooked in American art historical studies and exhibitions after his death in 1901, until institutions like the National Museum of African Art returned him to national attention in the 1960s and 1970s.\n\n",
        "simplified": "Edward Mitchell Bannister was a Canadian-American painter who lived from 1828 to 1901. He painted using oil paints and was part of a style called the American Barbizon school. He was born in a small area of Canada called New Brunswick and later lived in New England, in the United States. \n\nHe and his wife, Christiana Carteaux, were active in important social and political groups, including the fight against slavery in Boston. Bannister became well-known after winning a prize at the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition. He also helped start the Providence Art Club and the Rhode Island School of Design.\n\nBannister’s paintings often showed peaceful countryside scenes, and he was inspired by a French painter named Jean-François Millet and the Barbizon school. He had also spent much of his life as a sailor and found inspiration in the Rhode Island coast. He tried out different techniques and styles, and his work showed his beliefs and his skill with color and light. He started his art career taking photographs and painting portraits before focusing on landscapes.\n\nAs time went on, people didn’t really like his landscape paintings as much, and he sold fewer of them. He and his wife moved away from Providence to Boston and then to a smaller house on Wilson Street. For many years after he died in 1901, he wasn’t recognized by art historians or shown in important exhibitions. However, in the 1960s and 1970s, museums like the National Museum of African Art helped to bring his work back into the public eye.",
