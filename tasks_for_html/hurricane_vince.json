        "original": "Hurricane Vince was an unusual tropical cyclone that developed in the northeastern Atlantic basin. Forming in October during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, it strengthened over waters thought to be too cold for tropical development. Vince was the twentieth named storm and twelfth hurricane of the extremely active season.\nVince developed from an extratropical system on 8 October, becoming a subtropical storm southeast of the Azores. The United States National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not officially name the storm until the next day, shortly before Vince became a hurricane. The storm weakened at sea and made an extremely rare landfall on the Iberian Peninsula as a tropical depression on 11 October. Vince was one of only three tropical or subtropical cyclones to do so, alongside the 1842 Spanish hurricane and Subtropical Storm Alpha of 2020. It dissipated over Spain, bringing much-needed rain to the region, and its remnants passed into the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n",
        "simplified": "Hurricane Vince was a rare storm that formed in the northeast Atlantic Ocean. It happened in October 2005, during a very busy hurricane season. What made Vince unusual was that it grew strong in waters that were thought to be too cold for hurricanes to form.\n\nVince started as a different kind of storm on October 8, then became a subtropical storm near the Azores islands. The next day, weather experts officially named it and soon after, it became a full hurricane.\n\nThe storm got weaker as it moved over the ocean. On October 11, it hit land in Spain and Portugal as a weak tropical storm. This almost never happens in that area. Only two other similar storms have ever hit there, one in 1842 and another in 2020.\n\nAfter reaching land, Vince broke up over Spain. It brought some much-needed rain to the area before its leftovers moved into the Mediterranean Sea.",

Forming in October during the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, it strengthened over waters thought to be too cold for tropical development. Vince was the twentieth named storm and twelfth hurricane of the extremely active season.\nVince developed from an extratropical system on 8 October, becoming a subtropical storm southeast of the Azores. The United States National Hurricane Center (NHC) did not officially name the storm until the next day, shortly before Vince became a hurricane. The storm weakened at sea and made an extremely rare landfall on the Iberian Peninsula as a tropical depression on 11 October. Vince was one of only three tropical or subtropical cyclones to do so, alongside the 1842 Spanish hurricane and Subtropical Storm Alpha of 2020. It dissipated over Spain, bringing much-needed rain to the region, and its remnants passed into the Mediterranean Sea.\n\n",
        "simplified": "Hurricane Vince was a strange storm that happened in the north-east part of the Atlantic Ocean during the 2005 hurricane season. It grew stronger than expected, even though the ocean water was colder than usual for a tropical storm to form. Vince was the 20th storm and the 12th hurricane of a very busy season.\n\nThe storm started as a non-tropical system on October 8th and then turned into a subtropical storm south of the Azores islands. The U.S. National Hurricane Center didn’t give it a name until the following day, just before it became a hurricane.  It got weaker as it traveled across the ocean and then, very rarely, it hit land in Portugal on October 11th as a weak tropical depression.  Only three other tropical or subtropical storms have ever done this before – a hurricane in 1842 and a subtropical storm in 2020.  The storm disappeared over Spain, bringing rain to the area, and its pieces then moved into the Mediterranean Sea.",
