She was the first female Foreign Service officer in the United States Foreign Service to work under the United States Department of Commerce, the first woman to serve as an assistant trade commissioner, and the first woman to serve as trade commissioner.\nSmith was born and raised in Stockton, California. In 1917, she moved to Washington, D.C. While working for the United States Department of Labor, she attended the Washington College of Law part-time, earning her bachelor of laws in 1920. In October that year she joined the Foreign Service and was assigned to Beijing as a clerk in the trade commissioner's office. Smith was promoted to assistant trade commissioner in Shanghai in 1922, and appointed trade commissioner of Shanghai in 1928, a post she held until 1939. For the remainder of her career, she held several roles in the United States government, international organizations, and the United Nations.\nThroughout her life, Smith was also a member of several feminist organizations; scholars have described her international feminist activism as being rooted in imperialist and colonialist attitudes. Smith met her life partner, Eleanor Hinder, in Shanghai in 1926. They lived together until Hinder's death in 1963. Smith died on December 13, 1975, aged 82, in Mosman, New South Wales, and was cremated. She and Hinder were memorialized by their friends with two stone seats at the E.G. Waterhouse National Camellia Gardens in Caringbah.\n\n",

She was a very important figure because she was the first woman to hold this position within the U.S. Foreign Service, which was part of the Department of Commerce.\n\nAddie grew up in Stockton, California, and later moved to Washington, D.C. She studied law at Washington College of Law and became a clerk in the trade commissioner’s office in Beijing in 1917.  She was promoted to assistant trade commissioner in Shanghai in 1922 and then became the trade commissioner of Shanghai in 1928, a role she kept until 1939. After this, she continued to work for the U.S. government, various international groups, and the United Nations.\n\nAddie was also involved in feminist movements. Some historians believe her activism was influenced by the ideas of the time regarding empires and colonies. In Shanghai in 1926, she met Eleanor Hinder, and they lived together until Eleanor died in 1963. Addie died in 1975 at the age of 82 in Australia.  Her friends created two stone benches in the E.G.
