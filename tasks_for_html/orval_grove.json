In 207 career games, Grove pitched 1,176 innings and posted a win–loss record of 63–73, with 66 complete games, 11 shutouts, and a 3.78 earned run average (ERA).\nThe only freshman on the Proviso Township High School varsity baseball team, Grove's pitching ability attracted the attention of the White Sox. After signing with the team in 1937, Grove moved between the major leagues and minor leagues for a few seasons until 1943, when he found a solid place in the White Sox's pitching rotation. Grove had a career-year in 1943, finishing the season with career-bests in ERA, wins, and complete games; in 1944, he made his only All-Star appearance.\nGrove spent four more full seasons with the White Sox, and after pitching one game in 1949, was sent to the Sacramento Solons of the Pacific Coast League. After playing four seasons with them, he formally retired from professional baseball. After retirement, he worked with his uncle in a trucking business in Chicago while continuing to pitch at the semi-pro level. In 1992, Grove died at the age of 72.",

In 207 career games, Grove pitched 1,176 innings and posted a win–loss record of 63–73, with 66 complete games, 11 shutouts, and a 3.78 earned run average (ERA).\nThe only freshman on the Proviso Township High School varsity baseball team, Grove's pitching ability attracted the attention of the White Sox. After signing with the team in 1937, Grove moved between the major leagues and minor leagues for a few seasons until 1943, when he found a solid place in the White Sox's pitching rotation. Grove had a career-year in 1943, finishing the season with career-bests in ERA, wins, and complete games; in 1944, he made his only All-Star appearance.\nGrove spent four more full seasons with the White Sox, and after pitching one game in 1949, was sent to the Sacramento Solons of the Pacific Coast League. After playing four seasons with them, he formally retired from professional baseball. After retirement, he worked with his uncle in a trucking business in Chicago while continuing to pitch at the semi-pro level. In 1992, Grove died at the age of 72.",
        "simplified": "Orval Leroy Grove was born on August 29, 1919, and died on April 20, 1992. He was a baseball pitcher who played in Major League Baseball for ten years in the American League, specifically for the Chicago White Sox. He played a total of 207 games, throwing 1,176 innings. Over his career, he won 63 games and lost 73, and he completed 66 games – meaning he finished every game he started. He also had 11 shutouts, where he didn’t allow the other team to score at all. His average earned run allowed was 3.78.\n\nOrval started out as a talented young pitcher in high school, and the Chicago White Sox noticed him when he signed with the team in 1937. For a few years, he moved back and forth between the big leagues and smaller leagues until 1943, when he became a regular pitcher for the White Sox. He had his best year in 1943, setting personal records for ERA, wins, and complete games. In 1944, he was even chosen to play in the All-Star game.\n\nHe continued to pitch for the White Sox for four more years, but in 1949, he moved to a team in the Pacific Coast League called the Sacramento Solons. He played there for four more seasons before retiring from professional baseball. After retiring, he worked with his uncle in a trucking business in Chicago and still played baseball in local, semi-professional leagues. He passed away at the age of 72 in 1992.",
