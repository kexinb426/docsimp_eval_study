        "title": "Letter-winged kite",
        "model_id": "claude_editor",
        "original": "The letter-winged kite (Elanus scriptus) is a small, rare and irruptive bird of prey that is found only in Australia. Measuring around 35 cm (14 in) in length with a wingspan of 84\u2013100 cm (33\u201339 in), the adult letter-winged kite has predominantly pale grey and white plumage and prominent black rings around its red eyes. Its name derives from its highly distinctive black underwing pattern of a shallow 'M' or 'W' shape, visible when in flight. This distinguishes it from the otherwise similar black-shouldered kite. This species is also the only nocturnal species within the order Accipitriformes despite few differences found in its visual anatomy to other closely related kites.\nThe species begins breeding in response to rodent outbreaks, with pairs nesting in loose colonies of up to 50 birds each. Three to four eggs are laid and incubated for around thirty days, though the eggs may be abandoned if the food source disappears. Chicks are fledged within five weeks of hatching. Roosting in well-foliaged trees during the day, the letter-winged kite hunts mostly at night. It is a specialist predator of rodents, which it hunts by hovering above grasslands and fields. It is rated as near threatened on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List of Threatened Species.\n\n",
        "simplified": "The letter-winged kite is a small, uncommon bird of prey found only in Australia. It's about 35 cm (14 inches) long with wings that spread 84-100 cm (33-39 inches). The adult bird is mostly light gray and white, with black rings around its red eyes. It gets its name from the black 'M' or 'W' shape on its wings, which you can see when it flies. This makes it different from the similar-looking black-shouldered kite. It's the only bird in its group that hunts at night, even though its eyes aren't very different from other related birds.\n\nThese kites start breeding when there are lots of rodents around. They nest in groups of up to 50 birds. The female lays 3-4 eggs, which hatch after about 30 days. If food becomes scarce, the birds might leave their eggs. Baby birds can fly within 5 weeks of hatching. During the day, letter-winged kites rest in leafy trees. They hunt mostly at night, catching rodents by hovering over grassy areas and fields. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists this bird as \"near threatened\" on its list of animals at risk of extinction.",
