        "original": "Banksia aculeata, commonly known as prickly banksia, is a species of plant of the family Proteaceae native to the Stirling Range in the southwest of Western Australia. A shrub up to 2 m (7 ft) tall, it has dense foliage and leaves with very prickly serrated margins. Its unusual pinkish, pendent (hanging) flower spikes, known as inflorescences, are generally hidden in the foliage and appear during the early summer. Although it was collected by the naturalist James Drummond in the 1840s, Banksia aculeata was not formally described until 1981, by Alex George in his monograph of the genus.\nA rare plant, Banksia aculeata is found in gravelly soils in elevated areas. Native to a habitat burnt by periodic bushfires, it is killed by fire and regenerates from seed afterwards. In contrast to other Western Australian banksias, it appears to have some resistance to the soil-borne water mould Phytophthora cinnamomi.\n\n",
        "simplified": "Banksia aculeata, also called prickly banksia, is a plant that grows in southwest Western Australia, specifically in the Stirling Range. It's part of the Proteaceae family. This plant is a bush that can grow up to 2 meters (7 feet) tall. It has thick, leafy growth with very sharp, saw-like edges on its leaves.\n\nThe plant has unusual pink flowers that hang down and are often hidden among the leaves. These flowers appear in early summer. Although a nature expert named James Drummond found this plant in the 1840s, it wasn't officially described until 1981. Alex George, a scientist, wrote about it in his detailed study of the Banksia genus.\n\nPrickly banksia is not common. It grows in rocky soil in higher areas. In its natural home, bushfires happen regularly. The plant dies in these fires but new plants grow from seeds afterward. Unlike other banksias from Western Australia, this plant seems to have some ability to resist a harmful water mould called Phytophthora cinnamomi that lives in the soil.",
