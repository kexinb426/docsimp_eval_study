In 1917, she moved to Washington, D.C. While working for the Department of Labor, she went to law school at night and got her law degree in 1920. She joined the Foreign Service in October that year and worked in Beijing as a clerk. She was promoted to assistant trade commissioner in Shanghai in 1922 and then became the trade commissioner in 1928, a job she held until 1939. After that, she worked for the U.S. government, international groups, and the United Nations.\n\nSmith was also part of several women's rights groups. Scholars have said her work in these groups was influenced by imperialist and colonialist views. She met her life partner, Eleanor Hinder, in Shanghai in 1926, and they lived together until Hinder's death in 1963. Smith died at 82 on December 13, 1975, in Mosman, New South Wales, and was cremated. Friends remembered Smith and Hinder by creating two stone seats at the E.G. Waterhouse National Camellia Gardens in Caringbah.",
